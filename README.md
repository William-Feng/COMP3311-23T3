# COMP3311 23T3 Tutorial

Hey there!

This Git repository contains all of my live coding during the tutorial each week.

Note that this doesn't have any detailed comments or responses to the theoretical questions, so please try to follow along when I do the walkthroughs and explain the most important problems.

If you have any queries (bad pun?) or concerns, feel free to shoot me an email at [william.q.feng@student.unsw.edu.au](mailto:william.q.feng@student.unsw.edu.au).

> _Why did the SQL query go to the therapist?_
> It had too many inner joins and couldn't resolve its relationships.

Happy coding ğŸ˜Š
